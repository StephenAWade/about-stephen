<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        My name is Stephen Wade and I am writer, musician, and educator living in Albuquerque, New Mexico.
        I recently graduated with a Master's Degree while living in Chicago and am taking the CNM Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp
        so as to gain vital and employable skills while pursuing my love of written communication and music composition.

    <p>
        My owner Kayla takes me on walks and I can boast a certain degree of off-leash training, although strangers mistake my friendly enthusiasm for
        agression and sometimes poke with with sticks. I am also potty trained and rarely make messes on the rug. If found, please feed me gluten free
        biscuits and send me on my merry way.
    </p>
